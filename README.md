        body_format: form-multipart
        body:
          filedata: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/source/config.yaml') }}"
          theme: "configurations"
    ```

    This task uses the `uri` module to upload a configuration file to Mini-Cloud. We specify the upload URL, the HTTP POST method, headers, and the request body, which includes the file and the theme under which it should be uploaded.

**Example Ansible Playbook for Configuring and Deploying an Application**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure and deploy application
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure configuration file is present
      get_url:
        url: http://localhost:3000/api/download/app-config.yaml
        dest: /etc/myapp/config.yaml

    - name: Start the application
      service:
        name: myapp
        state: started
```

This Ansible playbook downloads a configuration file from Mini-Cloud and places it in the appropriate location on the server, then starts the application service using the downloaded configuration file.

**Example Playbook for Uploading Terraform State File**

```yaml
---
- name: Upload Terraform state file to Mini-Cloud
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Upload state file
      uri:
        url: http://localhost:3000/api/upload
        method: POST
        headers:
          Content-Type: multipart/form-data
        body_format: form-multipart
        body:
          filedata: "{{ lookup('file', 'terraform.tfstate') }}"
          theme: "state-files"
```

This Ansible playbook uploads a Terraform state file to Mini-Cloud, allowing you to easily manage state files when using Terraform

 for infrastructure management.

These examples demonstrate how to use Mini-Cloud API for integration with Ansible, automating tasks for uploading and downloading configuration and state files.

#### Terraform Integration

```hcl
provider "http" {}

data "http" "download_config" {
  url = "http://localhost:3000/api/download/config.yaml"
}

resource "local_file" "config" {
  content  = data.http.download_config.response_body
  filename = "/path/to/destination/config.yaml"
}

resource "null_resource" "upload_state" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOT
      curl -X POST -F "filedata=@/path/to/source/terraform.tfstate" -F "theme=configurations" http://localhost:3000/api/upload
    EOT
  }
}
```

This Terraform configuration uses the `http` provider to download a configuration file from Mini-Cloud and store it locally. It also includes a `null_resource` to upload a Terraform state file to Mini-Cloud using a local-exec provisioner.

## Further Enhancements

Given the project structure, here are some suggestions on how to extend and improve your Mini-Cloud API project:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: You can create a new folder called `/middlewares` to store authentication and authorization middleware functions. You can then use these middlewares in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to secure access to files and themes.
2. **File Encryption**: You can create a new folder called `/utils` to store utility functions, including file encryption and decryption functions. You can then use these functions in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to encrypt and decrypt files before storing or retrieving them.
3. **Versioning and Backup**: You can create a new folder called `/services` to store services related to file versioning and backup. You can then use these services in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to manage file versions and backups.
4. **Search and Filtering**: You can create a new folder called `/search` to store search and filtering functions. You can then use these functions in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to enable search and filtering capabilities for files and themes.
5. **Collaboration and Sharing**: You can create a new folder called `/collaboration` to store collaboration and sharing functions. You can then use these functions in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to enable file sharing and collaboration features.
6. **Webhooks and Notifications**: You can create a new folder called `/notifications` to store notification functions. You can then use these functions in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to send notifications to users about file uploads, downloads, deletions, or other events.
7. **Mobile App Support**: You can create a new folder called `/mobile` to store mobile app-related code and resources. You can then use this folder to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms.
8. **Performance Optimization**: You can create a new folder called `/performance` to store performance optimization functions. You can then use these functions in your route handlers in the `/routes` folder to implement caching, compression, and other performance enhancement techniques.
9. **Scalability and High Availability**: You can create a new folder called `/cloud` to store cloud-related code and resources. You can then use this folder to implement load balancing, auto-scaling, and other cloud-native features to ensure scalability and high availability.
10. **Integration with Third-Party Services**: You can create a new folder called `/integrations` to store integration code and resources for third-party services. You can then use this folder to integrate Mini-Cloud API with third-party services like Dropbox, Box, or OneDrive.

By following this suggested project structure, you can keep your code organized and maintainable as you add new features and enhancements to your Mini-Cloud API project.
